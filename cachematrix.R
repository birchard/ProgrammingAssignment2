##  Calculates the inverse of a square, invertable matrix and caches the result

##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
##  Assumes that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
##  returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##  If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##  then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
